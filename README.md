This was a real dud for me.

I had no luck finding the data needed, and the database took much longer than i wanted. I copied most off of random websites using delimiters in excel to low success. I sincerely hope you guys had a better time finding the data.

I ran into an error: "System.InvalidOperationException: 'The 'Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0' provider is not registered on the local machine.'"
The solutions online said to download microsoft access database engine, which didnt work for me initially. It took downloading a dozen different versions and some registry editing for it to work, as well as restarting the project several times. and even now im not fully sure how or why it started working. 

After all of that, I spent most of my time writing code that didnt work and then deleting it right after.

Excuses, excuses, I know, but I would rather be known as stupid than lazy.

Sorry for venting.
